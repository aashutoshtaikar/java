=====
Note:
=====
	======
	JUNIT:
	======
	1. Add JNUIT to eclipse projects 
		=> right click on project -> buildpath -> add libraries -> JNUIT 5.0	
		OR
		=> Maven -> pom file -> add path to JUNIT lib
	
	2. Test Case Methods:
		=> Positive scenarios
		=> Negative	scenarios as well
		
	3. Annotations:
		@Test
		@BeforeClass
		@AfterClass
		@Before
		@After
		@Ignore
			etc...
		
		
	4. Assert Methods
		assertEquals();
		assertNotEquals();
		assertNull();
		assertNotNull();
		assertSame();
		fail();
			etc...
	
	Note:
	=====
	>> use fail() 
		from Assert for the catch blocks in the cases where we do not expect the execution flow to go
		use for, Whatever we dont want to test in that method
		
	>> 	Writing a TestSuite for the entire project
	
	JUNIT tutorials point:
		Using assertions
		Run test methods in specific order @FixedMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)
		>>NOT COVERED -> JUNIT 1.4 -> Parameterized Testing
