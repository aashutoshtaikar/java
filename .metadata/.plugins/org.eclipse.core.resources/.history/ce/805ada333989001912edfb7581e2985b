  # JVM architecture
  Byte code -> Class loader subsystem
  
  # Need of static block: 
  static {}
  To enable log 4J function - as static block executes before main method
  Log 4J - open source framework for recording activity of the application
  
  # Instance block : 
  {}
  Executed whenever we create an object
  Executed before constructor call
