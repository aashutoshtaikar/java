  #JVM internal memory:
  ====================
  instance variables -> seperate mem locations per object (object level dependency, independent from class dependency)
  static variables -> same mem location allocated as per class (class level dependency, independent from objects dependency)
  
  # JVM architecture
  Byte code -> Class loader subsystem
  
  # Static VS instance methods:
  ============================
  Static 	-> one time operations(getting a connection from db)
  instance  -> repeated operations(reading data from file)
  
  # Need of static block: 
  static {}
  To enable log 4J function - as static block executes before main method
  Log 4J - open source framework for recording activity of the application
  
  # Instance block : 
  {}
  Executed whenever we create an object
  Executed before constructor call
