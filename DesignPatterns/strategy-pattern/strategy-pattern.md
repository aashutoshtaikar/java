Strategy pattern
=================

- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangable. 
- The Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- Use strategy pattern when there is a similarity in a type and loosecouple the type to dynamically use it by composition.
